The following dataset was created using public information. The codes used to represent airports refer to each state in Brazil. The flight information is aggregated so as to determine the amount of people that travel per year from one Brazilian state to another. . flight_path_df = pd.read_csv(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leonardodecastro/data/main/airplane_flights_brazil.csv&#39;) . 2.3) Bird Migration Dataset . 2.3.1) Load dataset . bird_routes_df = pd.read_csv(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leonardodecastro/data/main/anon_gps_tracks_with_dive.csv&#39;) . 2.3.2) Clean the dataset . # Step 1: Limit the dataset to the features we seek to investigate final_bird_df = bird_routes_df[[&#39;lat&#39;,&#39;lon&#39;,&#39;bird&#39;,&#39;date_time&#39;,&#39;species&#39;,&#39;alt&#39;]] # Step 2: Transform the date time variables final_bird_df[&#39;date_time&#39;] = pd.to_datetime(final_bird_df[&#39;date_time&#39;]) # Step 3: Set the date time variable as the index do that we can resample the dataset for every 15 minutes final_bird_df.set_index(&quot;date_time&quot;,inplace=True) final_bird_df = final_bird_df.groupby([&#39;bird&#39;,&#39;species&#39;]).resample(&#39;15min&#39;).mean() # Step 4: Reset the dataset index final_bird_df = final_bird_df.reset_index(level=1) final_bird_df = final_bird_df.drop(&#39;bird&#39;, axis=1).reset_index() # Step 5: Make sure the bird identifier is considered a string final_bird_df[&#39;bird&#39;] = final_bird_df[&#39;bird&#39;].astype(&#39;int&#39;).astype(&#39;str&#39;) # Step 6: Part of the analysis is focused on the Rathlin Island.

We need to use ISO codes with 3 letters for plotly.express to work properly . # Step 1: Create visualization fig = px.choropleth(GDP_growth_df[GDP_growth_df[&#39;Year&#39;]&gt;=1961], # Limit the analysis to years for which that is plenty of data locations=&quot;Country Code&quot;, # Column where country code with 3 letters can be found color=&quot;Indicator Value&quot;, # Indicator Value is the numerical value we want to examine hover_name=&quot;Country Code&quot;, # Column to add to hover information animation_frame=&#39;Year&#39;, # Show column that will be used in the animation frame color_continuous_scale=px.colors.diverging.RdYlGn, # Select the type of divergent color scheme to be used height = 700) # Adjust the size of the figure # Step 2: Control the speed of the transitions fig.layout.updatemenus[0].buttons[0].args[1][&#39;frame&#39;][&#39;duration&#39;] = 1000 fig.layout.updatemenus[0].buttons[0].args[1][&#39;transition&#39;][&#39;duration&#39;] = 10 # Step 3: Add title to the plot fig.update_layout(title_text=&#39;GDP Yealy Growth (%)&#39;, title_x=0.5) # Step 4: Syle the map fig.update_geos(showocean=True, oceancolor=&quot;#99cccc&quot;) fig.show() . . . Insight: The map uses divergent colors that help determine which countries are doing better each year. However, the color legend varies every year, which means that at times red can mean small positive growth while the very same red color can mean -25% annual GDP growth. The following visualization address this limitation. . 3.1.2) Using discrete color schemes . # Step 1: Create a dictionary to map colors to each of the categories color_discrete_dict = {&#39;nan&#39;: &#39;#4d4d4d&#39;, &#39;&lt; -10 %&#39;: &#39;#d73027&#39;, &#39;-10% to -5%&#39; : &#39;#fc8d59&#39;, &#39;-5% to 0%&#39; : &#39;#fee08b&#39;, &#39;0% to 5%&#39; : &#39;#d9ef8b&#39;, &#39;5% to 10%&#39; : &#39;#91cf60&#39;, &#39;&gt; 10%&#39; : &#39;#1a9850&#39;} # Step 2: Create a dictionary with order of the legend labels category_orders_dict = {&#39;Growth Ranges&#39; : [&#39;nan&#39;, &#39;&lt; -10 %&#39; , &#39;-10% to -5%&#39;, &#39;-5% to 0%&#39;,&#39;0% to 5%&#39;,&#39;5% to 10%&#39;, &#39;&gt; 10%&#39;]} # Step 3: Create visualization fig = px.choropleth(GDP_growth_df[GDP_growth_df[&#39;Year&#39;]&gt;=1961], # Limit the analysis to years for which that is plenty of data locations=&quot;Country Code&quot;, # Column where country code with 3 letters can be found color=&quot;Growth Ranges&quot;, # Indicator Value is the numerical value we want to examine color_discrete_map = color_discrete_dict, # Dictionary to map colors to each of the categories category_orders= category_orders_dict, # Dictionary with order of the legend labels hover_name=&quot;Country Code&quot;, # Column to add to hover information animation_frame=&#39;Year&#39;, # Show column that will be used in the animation frame height = 700) # Adjust the size of the figure # Step 4: Control the speed of the transitions fig.layout.updatemenus[0].buttons[0].args[1][&#39;frame&#39;][&#39;duration&#39;] = 1000 fig.layout.updatemenus[0].buttons[0].args[1][&#39;transition&#39;][&#39;duration&#39;] = 10 # Step 5: Add title to the plot fig.update_layout(title_text=&#39;GDP Yealy Growth (%)&#39;, title_x=0.5) # Step 6: Syle the map fig.update_geos(showocean=True, oceancolor=&quot;#99cccc&quot;) fig.show() . . . Insight: The map uses divergent colors that help determine which countries are doing better each year. The use of discrete colors help maintain color consistency for each year animation. . 3.1.3) More than one animated map side by side . We first select 2 variables that we seek to investigate and create a dataframe that contain both of them. . # Step 1: Select 2 variables that we seek to investigate data = world_data_df[world_data_df[&#39;Indicator Name&#39;].isin([&#39;Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (national estimate)&#39;,&#39;GDP growth (annual %)&#39;])] # Step 2: Convert the unemployment variable into an employment variable data[&#39;Indicator Value&#39;] = np.where(data[&#39;Indicator Name&#39;] == &#39;Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (national estimate)&#39;, 100 - data[&#39;Indicator Value&#39;], data[&#39;Indicator Value&#39;]) # Step 3: Encode these variables in terms of quantile for and easier interpration of these variables when compared later on data[&#39;Quantile&#39;] = data.groupby([&#39;Indicator Name&#39;])[&#39;Indicator Value&#39;].transform(lambda x: pd.qcut(x, q=[0,.2,.4,.6,.8,1], labels=[&#39;Q1&#39;,&#39;Q2&#39;,&#39;Q3&#39;,&#39;Q4&#39;,&#39;Q5&#39;])) # Step 4: Make sure the categories are in the string format data[&#39;Quantile&#39;] = data[&#39;Quantile&#39;].astype(&#39;str&#39;) # Step 5: Change certain terms for better visualization later data[&#39;Indicator Name&#39;] = data[&#39;Indicator Name&#39;].map({&#39;GDP growth (annual %)&#39;:&#39;GDP Growth (annual %)&#39;,&#39;Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (national estimate)&#39;:&#39;Employment (% of total labor force)&#39;}) . Create the visualization to evaluate if GDP Growth is often negatively correlated with Unemployment Rates. . # Step 1: Create a dictionary to map colors to each of the categories color_discrete_dict = {&#39;nan&#39;: &#39;#4d4d4d&#39;, &#39;Q1&#39;: &#39;#d7191c&#39;, &#39;Q2&#39; : &#39;#fdae61&#39;, &#39;Q3&#39; : &#39;#ffffbf&#39;, &#39;Q4&#39; : &#39;#a6d96a&#39;, &#39;Q5&#39; : &#39;#1a9641&#39;} # Step 2: Create a dictionary with order of the legend labels category_orders_dict = {&#39;Quantile&#39; : [&#39;nan&#39;, &#39;Q1&#39;,&#39;Q2&#39;,&#39;Q3&#39;,&#39;Q4&#39;,&#39;Q5&#39;]} # Step 3: Create visualization fig = px.choropleth(data[data[&#39;Year&#39;].isin(list(range(1980,2015)))], # Limit the analysis to years for which that is plenty of data locations=&quot;Country Code&quot;, # Column where country code with 3 letters can be found color=&quot;Quantile&quot;, # Indicator Value is the numerical value we want to examine color_discrete_map = color_discrete_dict, # Dictionary to map colors to each of the categories category_orders= category_orders_dict, # Dictionary with order of the legend labels hover_name=&quot;Country Code&quot;, # Column to add to hover information animation_frame=&#39;Year&#39;, # Show column that will be used in the animation frame facet_col = &#39;Indicator Name&#39;) # Feature that determines the split into 2 columns with different types of info # Step 4: Control the speed of the transitions fig.layout.updatemenus[0].buttons[0].args[1][&#39;frame&#39;][&#39;duration&#39;] = 1000 fig.layout.updatemenus[0].buttons[0].args[1][&#39;transition&#39;][&#39;duration&#39;] = 10 # Step 5: Prevent redundant legend names = set() fig.for_each_trace(lambda trace: trace.update(showlegend=False) if (trace.name in names) else names.add(trace.name)) # Step 6: Prevent &quot;Indicator Name&quot; from appearing as the label of the fact column fig.for_each_annotation(lambda a: a.update(text=a.text.split(&quot;=&quot;)[-1])) # Step 7: Add title to the plot fig.update_layout(title_text=&#39;Growth VS Employment&#39;, title_x=0.5) # Step 8: Syle the map fig.update_geos(showocean=True, oceancolor=&quot;#99cccc&quot;) fig.show() . . . Insight: The map uses divergent colors that help determine which countries are doing better each year. The use of discrete colors help maintain color consistency for each year animation. Moreover, the use quantiles allows for the comparison between variables with different meanings and that often present different orders of magnitude. The animation shows that GDP Growth and Employment are often not correlated. Some countries such as the United States often present good employment metrics despite negative GDP Growth. . 4) Time Series Visualizations (Undirected Graphs of Maps) . The dataset used in this part of the tutorial was created by the author by aggregating data related to 2 decades of flight paths in Brazil. The code used to aggregate such data will not be disclosed here since it would be out of the scope of this tutorial. The CSV files are available at: https://www.gov.br/anac/pt-br/assuntos/dados-e-estatisticas/dados-estatisticos/dados-estatisticos . 4.1) Visualize the flight volume between Brazilian states for 1 year . # Step 1: Limit the analysis to the flight data for 2001 flight_path_df_2001 = flight_path_df[flight_path_df[&#39;Year&#39;]==2001] # Step 2: Create a figure fig = go.Figure() # Step 3: Zip data in a convenient way for later use source_to_dest = zip(flight_path_df_2001[&#39;start_lat&#39;], flight_path_df_2001[&#39;end_lat&#39;], flight_path_df_2001[&#39;start_lon&#39;], flight_path_df_2001[&#39;end_lon&#39;], flight_path_df_2001[&#39;Number Passengers&#39;]) # Step 4: Add line between the airports of origin and destination for slat,dlat, slon, dlon, num_flights in source_to_dest: fig.add_trace(go.Scattergeo(lat = [slat,dlat], lon = [slon, dlon], mode = &#39;lines&#39;, line = dict(width = num_flights/500000, color=&quot;lime&quot;))) # Step 5: Create labels used in the following part cities = flight_path_df_2001[&quot;airport_1&quot;].values.tolist() + flight_path_df_2001[&quot;airport_2&quot;].values.tolist() # Step 6: Plot airports of origin and destination fig.add_trace(go.Scattergeo(lon = flight_path_df_2001[&#39;start_lon&#39;].values.tolist()+flight_path_df_2001[&#39;end_lon&#39;].values.tolist(), lat = flight_path_df_2001[&#39;start_lat&#39;].values.tolist()+flight_path_df_2001[&#39;end_lat&#39;].values.tolist(), hoverinfo = &#39;text&#39;, text = cities, mode = &#39;markers&#39;, marker = dict(size = 10, color = &#39;orangered&#39;, opacity=0.1,))) # Step 7: Style the map fig.update_layout(height=700, width=1000, margin={&quot;t&quot;:100,&quot;b&quot;:0,&quot;l&quot;:0, &quot;r&quot;:0, &quot;pad&quot;:0}, showlegend=False, title_text = &#39;Volume of passengers between 27 Brazilian States&#39;, title_x=0.5, geo = dict(projection_type = &#39;natural earth&#39;,scope = &#39;south america&#39;)) fig.update_geos(showcountries=True, countrycolor=&quot;Black&quot;, showcoastlines=True, coastlinecolor=&quot;RebeccaPurple&quot;, showland=True, landcolor=&quot;#C1E1C1&quot;, showocean=True, oceancolor=&quot;#99cccc&quot;,) # Step 8: Show the map fig.show() . . . Insight: We can see that the number of passengers flying between southern States in Brazil is much higher than the flow in the northern States. . 4.2) Visualize the flight volume between Brazilian states for 2 decades . We will not use animation for this visualization since it is not useful for the sake of certain report types (PDFs without the possibility of animation). Thus, it is also important to consider subplots as a visualization tool. Another reason for not using animation in this case is the fact that the go.Scattergeo does not provide this option. . # Step 1: Create a list with the years for the analysis and determine the number of columns and rows for the visualization years = list(range(2001,2022)) rows, cols = 7, 3 # Step 2: Create subplots fig = make_subplots(rows=rows, cols=cols, subplot_titles = years, specs = [[{&#39;type&#39;: &#39;scattergeo&#39;} for c in np.arange(cols)] for r in np.arange(rows)], horizontal_spacing = 0.01, vertical_spacing = 0.01) # Step 3: Create one visualization for each year using virtually the same code as in the previous part for i, year in enumerate(years): # 3.1) Limit the dataframe to a given year result = flight_path_df[flight_path_df[&#39;Year&#39;] == year] # 3.2) Zip data in a convenient way for later use source_to_dest = zip(result[&#39;start_lat&#39;], result[&#39;end_lat&#39;], result[&#39;start_lon&#39;], result[&#39;end_lon&#39;], result[&#39;Number Passengers&#39;]) # 3.3) Add line between the airports of origin and destination fig.add_trace(go.Scattergeo(lon = result[&#39;start_lon&#39;].values.tolist()+result[&#39;end_lon&#39;].values.tolist(), lat = result[&#39;start_lat&#39;].values.tolist()+result[&#39;end_lat&#39;].values.tolist(), hoverinfo = &#39;text&#39;, text = cities, mode = &#39;markers&#39;, marker = dict(size = 10, color = &#39;orangered&#39;, opacity=0.1,)), row = i//cols+1, col = i%cols+1) # 3.4) Create labels used in the following part for slat,dlat, slon, dlon, num_flights in source_to_dest: fig.add_trace(go.Scattergeo(lat = [slat,dlat], lon = [slon, dlon], mode = &#39;lines&#39;, line = dict(width = num_flights/500000, color=&quot;lime&quot;)), row = i//cols+1, col = i%cols+1) # 3.5) Plot airports of origin and destination cities = result[&quot;airport_1&quot;].values.tolist() + result[&quot;airport_2&quot;].values.tolist() # Step 4) Style the map fig.update_layout(height=1500, width=850, margin={&quot;t&quot;:100,&quot;b&quot;:0,&quot;l&quot;:0, &quot;r&quot;:0, &quot;pad&quot;:0}, showlegend=False, title_text = &#39;Volume of passengers between 27 Brazilian States&#39;, title_x=0.5) fig.update_geos(projection_scale = 4, center = dict(lat=-10.33333334, lon=-53.20000000),showcountries=True, countrycolor=&quot;Black&quot;, showcoastlines=True, coastlinecolor=&quot;RebeccaPurple&quot;, showland=True, landcolor=&quot;#C1E1C1&quot;, showocean=True, oceancolor=&quot;#99cccc&quot;,) # Step 5) Show the map fig.show() . . . Insight: We can see that the volume of passengers flying between Brazilian States has risen significantly throughout the years. However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a stark decrease in the number of people traveling in 2020 and 2021. . 5) Time Series Visualizations (Movement Tracking) . 5.1) Line plots for route representation . 5.1.1) Line plots representing groups (bird species) . # Create the visualization fig = px.line_mapbox(final_bird_df, lat=&quot;lat&quot;, lon=&quot;lon&quot;, color=&quot;species&quot;, zoom=3, height=500, width = 850) # Style the plot fig.update_layout(mapbox_style=&quot;stamen-terrain&quot;, mapbox_zoom=4.2, mapbox_center_lat = 56, mapbox_center_lon = -2.2, margin={&quot;r&quot;:0,&quot;t&quot;:50,&quot;l&quot;:0,&quot;b&quot;:0}) # Give a title to the visualization fig.update_layout(title_text=&#39;Bird Flying Behavior by Species&#39;, title_x=0.5) fig.show() . . . Insight: We can see that there are 3 species of birds that tend to fly over specific regions. . 5.1.2) Line plots representing individual birds (closer look) . # Limit the analysis to 6 birds that fly in a certain region df_6_birds = final_bird_df[final_bird_df[&#39;bird&#39;].isin([&#39;50&#39;, &#39;51&#39;, &#39;52&#39;, &#39;53&#39;, &#39;54&#39;, &#39;55&#39;, &#39;56&#39;])] # Create the visualization fig = px.line_mapbox(df_6_birds, lat=&quot;lat&quot;, lon=&quot;lon&quot;, color=&quot;bird&quot;, zoom=3, height=500, width = 850) # Style the plot fig.update_layout(mapbox_style=&quot;stamen-terrain&quot;, mapbox_zoom=8, mapbox_center_lat = 56.9, mapbox_center_lon = -2.2, margin={&quot;r&quot;:0,&quot;t&quot;:50,&quot;l&quot;:0,&quot;b&quot;:0}) # Give a title to the visualization fig.update_layout(title_text=&#39;Bird Flying (Individual Behavior)&#39;, title_x=0.5) fig.show() . . . Insight: Birds in a given region seem to have different routes but all seem to pass through a certain region (might be a resting place). . 5.1.3) Line plots with dots for precise locations . # Limit the analysis to 1 bird single_bird_df = final_bird_df[final_bird_df[&#39;bird&#39;]==&#39;55&#39;][[&#39;date_time&#39;, &#39;lat&#39;,&#39;lon&#39;, &#39;alt&#39;]] single_bird_df[&#39;date_time&#39;] = single_bird_df[&#39;date_time&#39;].astype(&#39;str&#39;) # Create the visualization fig = go.Figure() fig.add_trace(go.Scattermapbox( mode = &quot;markers+lines&quot;, lat = single_bird_df.lat.tolist(), lon = single_bird_df.lon.tolist(), marker = {&#39;color&#39;: &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;size&quot;: 7} )) # Style the plot fig.update_layout(margin ={&#39;l&#39;:0,&#39;t&#39;:50,&#39;b&#39;:0,&#39;r&#39;:0}, mapbox = { &#39;center&#39;: {&#39;lat&#39;: 56.8, &#39;lon&#39;: -2.2}, &#39;style&#39;: &quot;stamen-terrain&quot;, &#39;zoom&#39;: 8}, height=500) # Give a title to the visualization fig.update_layout(title_text=&#39;Single Bird Flying Path (Line Plot)&#39;, title_x=0.5) fig.show() . . . Insight: Since the points refer to the location every 15 minutes, further apart points indicate faster speed. Thus, the distance traveled and therefore the speed of the bird varies greatly. The next visualization helps to strenghten this argument. . 5.2) Animated Scatter Plot for Speed Visualization . # Scale the altitude feature since the size argument only accepts positive values scaler = MinMaxScaler() single_bird_df[[&#39;alt&#39;]] = scaler.fit_transform(single_bird_df[[&#39;alt&#39;]]) # Create the visualization fig = px.scatter_mapbox(single_bird_df, lat=&quot;lat&quot;, lon=&quot;lon&quot;, size = &#39;alt&#39;, animation_frame = &#39;date_time&#39;, zoom=8, height=600) fig.update_layout(mapbox_style=&quot;stamen-terrain&quot;) # Control the speed of the transitions fig.layout.updatemenus[0].buttons[0].args[1][&#39;frame&#39;][&#39;duration&#39;] = 200 fig.layout.updatemenus[0].buttons[0].args[1][&#39;transition&#39;][&#39;duration&#39;] = 20 # Give a title to the visualization fig.update_layout(title_text=&#39;Single Bird Flying Path (Animated Scatter Plot)&#39;, title_x=0.5) fig.show() . . . Insight: We can see that the altitude of the bird varies widely during its flight (as seen by the size of the dot varying). The speed of the animal also varies significantly during the flight, as we suspected. . 5.3) Density Plot for Closeness &amp; Altitude Visualization . 5.3.1) Density Plot for Closeness Visualization . Let us consider the density of points at Rathlin Island . # Create the visualization fig = px.density_mapbox(rathlin_island, lat=&#39;lat&#39;, lon=&#39;lon&#39;, zoom = 12, center=dict(lat=55.276, lon=-6.19), height=600, mapbox_style=&quot;stamen-terrain&quot;) # Give a title to the plot fig.update_layout(title_text=&#39;Density Plot for Closeness Visualization&#39;, title_x=0.5, margin ={&#39;l&#39;:0,&#39;t&#39;:50,&#39;b&#39;:0,&#39;r&#39;:0}) fig.show() . . . Insight: The south of the island is where the birds are most often found. . 5.3.2) Density Plot for Altitude Visualization . # Create the visualization fig = px.density_mapbox(rathlin_island, lat=&#39;lat&#39;, lon=&#39;lon&#39;, z=&#39;alt&#39;, zoom = 12, center=dict(lat=55.276, lon=-6.19), height=600, mapbox_style=&quot;stamen-terrain&quot;) # Give a title to the plot fig.update_layout(title_text=&#39; Density Plot for Altitude Visualization&#39;, title_x=0.5, margin ={&#39;l&#39;:0,&#39;t&#39;:50,&#39;b&#39;:0,&#39;r&#39;:0}) fig.show() . . . Insight: Birds tend to fly at higher altitudes when in the south of the Island. . 5.3.3) Animated Density Plot for Altitude Visualization . # Create the visualization fig = px.density_mapbox(rathlin_island, lat=&#39;lat&#39;, lon=&#39;lon&#39;, z=&#39;alt&#39;, animation_frame = rathlin_island[&#39;date_time&#39;].astype(&#39;str&#39;), zoom = 12, center=dict(lat=55.276, lon=-6.19), height=600, mapbox_style=&quot;stamen-terrain&quot;, range_color = [rathlin_island[&#39;alt&#39;].min(),rathlin_island[&#39;alt&#39;].max()]) # Step 4: Control the speed of the transitions fig.layout.updatemenus[0].buttons[0].args[1][&#39;frame&#39;][&#39;duration&#39;] = 50 fig.layout.updatemenus[0].buttons[0].args[1][&#39;transition&#39;][&#39;duration&#39;] = 15 # Step 5: Give a title to the plot fig.update_layout(title_text=&#39;Animated Density Plot for Altitude Visualization&#39;, title_x=0.5, margin ={&#39;l&#39;:0,&#39;t&#39;:50,&#39;b&#39;:0,&#39;r&#39;:0}) fig.show() . . . Insight: This visualization might be a bit confusing at first since we can only see purple density plots. We could think that this contradicts the previous visualization where yellow represents birds that fly higher than others. This happens since this visualization considers the color as a representation of birds at each frame. Since birds fly together, we are bound to see the same color representing their altitudes at each point in time. If we had different colors, we would be able to affirm that many of these birds do not fly together, even when their latitudes and longitudes are approximately the same. .",

We can see that the metrics for the training and test set are fairly similar, which indicates that there is no problem with overfitting or underfitting. Moreover, the ROC curve indicates that the classifier outperforms a random classifier (the baseline). .",

There is minimal support for Word documents in fastpages compared to Jupyter notebooks. Some known limitations: . alt text in Word documents are not yet supported by fastpages, and will break links to images. . | You can only specify front matter for Word documents globally. See the README for more details. . | . For greater control over the content produced from Word documents, you will need to convert Word to markdown files manually. You can follow the steps in this blog post, which walk you through how to use pandoc to do the conversion. Note: If you wish to customize your Word generated blog post in markdown, make sure you delete your Word document from the _word directory so your markdown file doesn’t get overwritten! . If your primary method of writing blog posts is Word documents, and you plan on always manually editing Word generated markdown files, you are probably better off using fast_template instead of fastpages. . The material below is a reproduction of this blog post, and serves as an illustrative example. . Maintaining a healthy open source project can entail a huge amount of toil. Popular projects often have orders of magnitude more users and episodic contributors opening issues and PRs than core maintainers capable of handling these issues. . Consider this graphic prepared by the NumFOCUS foundation showing the number of maintainers for three widely used scientific computing projects: . . We can see that across these three projects, there is a very low ratio maintainers to users. Fixing this problem is not an easy task and likely requires innovative solutions to address the economics as well as tools. . Due to its recent momentum and popularity, Kubeflow suffers from a similar fate as illustrated by the growth of new issues opened: . . Source: “TensorFlow World 2019, Automating Your Developer Workflow With ML” . Coincidentally, while building out end to end machine learning examples for Kubeflow, we built two examples using publicly available GitHub data: GitHub Issue Summarization and Code Search. While these tutorials were useful for demonstrating components of Kubeflow, we realized that we could take this a step further and build concrete data products that reduce toil for maintainers. . This is why we started the project kubeflow/code-intelligence, with the goals of increasing project velocity and health using data driven tools. Below are two projects we are currently experimenting with : . Issue Label Bot: This is a bot that automatically labels GitHub issues using Machine Learning. This bot is a GitHub App that was originally built for Kubeflow but is now also used by several large open source projects. The current version of this bot only applies a very limited set of labels, however we are currently A/B testing new models that allow personalized labels. Here is a blog post discussing this project in more detail. . | Issue Triage GitHub Action: to compliment the Issue Label Bot, we created a GitHub Action that automatically adds / removes Issues to the Kubeflow project board tracking issues needing triage. . | Together these projects allow us to reduce the toil of triaging issues. The GitHub Action makes it much easier for the Kubeflow maintainers to track issues needing triage. With the label bot we have taken the first steps in using ML to replace human intervention. We plan on using features extracted by ML to automate more steps in the triage process to further reduce toil. . Building Solutions with GitHub Actions . One of the premises of Kubeflow is that a barrier to building data driven, ML powered solutions is getting models into production and integrated into a solution. In the case of building models to improve OSS project health, that often means integrating with GitHub where the project is hosted. . We are really excited by GitHub’s newly released feature GitHub Actions because we think it will make integrating ML with GitHub much easier. . For simple scripts, like the issue triage script, GitHub actions make it easy to automate executing the script in response to GitHub events without having to build and host a GitHub app. . To automate adding/removing issues needing triage to a Kanban board we wrote a simple python script that interfaces with GitHub’s GraphQL API to modify issues. . As we continue to iterate on ML Models to further reduce toil, GitHub Actions will make it easy to leverage Kubeflow to put our models into production faster. A number of prebuilt GitHub Actions make it easy to create Kubernetes resources in response to GitHub events. For example, we have created GitHub Actions to launch Argo Workflows. This means once we have a Kubernetes job or workflow to perform inference we can easily integrate the model with GitHub and have the full power of Kubeflow and Kubernetes (eg. GPUs). We expect this will allow us to iterate much faster compared to building and maintaining GitHub Apps. . Call To Action . We have a lot more work to do in order to achieve our goal of reducing the amount of toil involved in maintaining OSS projects. If your interested in helping out here’s a couple of issues to get started: . Help us create reports that pull and visualize key performance indicators (KPI). https://github.com/kubeflow/code-intelligence/issues/71 . We have defined our KPI here: issue #19 | . | Combine repo specific and non-repo specific label predictions: https://github.com/kubeflow/code-intelligence/issues/70 . | . In addition to the aforementioned issues we welcome contributions for these other issues in our repo. .",
